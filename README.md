## Business Understanding and Stakeholder
Currently institutions and businesses recognize signatures as the primary way of authenticating transactions. Signatures are used to sign checks, authorize documents and contracts, and validate credit card transactions. According to recent studies, check fraud costs banks about $900M a year with 22 percent of all fraudulent checks attributed to signature fraud.
